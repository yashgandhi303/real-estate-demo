--------------------

A simple (no compile) example of how to do server-side rendering with the
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library so that component code can be
shared between server and browser, as well as getting fast initial page loads
and search-engine-friendly pages.

A more complex example with shared routing and data fetching can be found at
[react-server-routing-example](https://github.com/mhart/react-server-routing-example).

Example
-------

```sh
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:7800](http://localhost:7800) and
click on the button to see some reactive events in action.
